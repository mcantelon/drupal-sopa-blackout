Blackout your Drupal site on January 18, 2012 as part of the global
anti-SOPA protest!

This module automates this via a quick hack.

Your site will look like:

  http://mikecantelon.com/?sopa_test=1

Your site will work normally until January 18, but on January 18 you
will only be able to access URLs starting with "user" and "admin"
without seeing the SOPA blackout page. After January 18 your site will
be back to normal.

Developed for/tested with Drupal 6 or Drupal 7. If using it with Drupal 7
just change "6.x" to "7.x" in the sopa.info file and you should be good
to go.

Inspired by WP-SOPA-Blackout:

Let me know if there's any problems with this version.
